## üåü Skills 
> Rigor   
> Imperative programming   
> Object-oriented programming

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installing and running the project:
1. Clone && cd
```
git clone https://github.com/ramos21rodrigo/42.cpp-modules.git && cd 42porto.cpp-modules
```
2. Cd to the module and exercise and 
```
cd cpp-module-0[1 - 9] && cd ex00
```
3. Run `make`
```
make
```
4. Now you can the program.
```
./<program name>
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Makefile Available Targets:
- `make` or `make all` - Makes the _program_

- `make clean` - Deletes all the resulting object files

- `make fclean` - Deletes  _program_ and all the resulting object files

- `make re` - Deletes everything (object files and  _program_) and rebuilds  _program_

## üìã Modules: 
#### [ [100/100] Module 00](https://github.com/ramos21rodrigo/42.cpp-modules/tree/master/cpp-module-00)
> This first module of C++ is designed to help you understand the specifities of the language when compared to C. Time to dive into Object Oriented Programming!
