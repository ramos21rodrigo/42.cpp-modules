### ♠️ Skills 
> Rigor <br/>
> Imperative programming <br/>
> Object-oriented programming

### ♥️ Installing and running the project:
1. Clone && cd
```
git clone https://github.com/ramos21rodrigo/42.cpp-modules.git && cd 42porto.cpp-modules
```
2. Cd to the module and exercise and 
```
cd cpp-module-0[1 - 9] && cd ex00
```
3. Run make
```
make
```
4. Now you can the program.
```
./<program name>
```

### ♣️ Makefile Available Targets:
- `make` or `make all` - Makes the _program_

- `make clean` - Deletes all the resulting object files

- `make fclean` - Deletes  _program_ and all the resulting object files

- `make re` - Deletes everything (object files and  _program_) and rebuilds  _program_

### ♦️ Modules: 
#### [Module 00](https://github.com/ramos21rodrigo/42.cpp-modules/tree/master/cpp-module-00)
> This first module of C++ is designed to help you understand the specifities of the language when compared to C. Time to dive into Object Oriented Programming!
#### [Module 01](https://github.com/ramos21rodrigo/42.cpp-modules/tree/master/cpp-module-01)
> This module is designed to help you understand the memory allocation, reference, pointers to members and the usage of the switch in CPP.
#### [Module 02](https://github.com/ramos21rodrigo/42.cpp-modules/tree/master/cpp-module-02)
> This module is designed to help you understand Ad-hoc polymorphism, overloads and orthodox canonical classes in CPP.
#### [Module 03](https://github.com/ramos21rodrigo/42.cpp-modules/tree/master/cpp-module-03)
> This module is designed to help you understand Inheritance in CPP.
#### [Module 04](https://github.com/ramos21rodrigo/42.cpp-modules/tree/master/cpp-module-04)
> This module is designed to help you understand Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces in CPP.
#### [Module 05](https://github.com/ramos21rodrigo/42.cpp-modules/tree/master/cpp-module-05)
> This module is designed to help you understand Try/Catch and Exceptions in CPP.
#### [Module 06](https://github.com/ramos21rodrigo/42.cpp-modules/tree/master/cpp-module-06)
> This module is designed to help you understand the different casts in CPP.
#### [Module 07](https://github.com/ramos21rodrigo/42.cpp-modules/tree/master/cpp-module-07)
> This module is designed to help you understand Templates in CPP.
#### [Module 08](https://github.com/ramos21rodrigo/42.cpp-modules/tree/master/cpp-module-08)
> This module is designed to help you understand templated containers, iterators and algorithms in CPP.
#### [Module 09](https://github.com/ramos21rodrigo/42.cpp-modules/tree/master/cpp-module-09)
> This module is designed to help you understand the containers in CPP.
